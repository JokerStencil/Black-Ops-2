	<h1>Campaign (main story) Synopsis</h1>
	<br>
	<article>
		<p>In July 1986, retired CIA operative Alex Mason (Sam Worthington) lives an obscure life in Alaska with his son David. One day, his former handler Jason Hudson (Michael Keaton) shows up with an assignment: Mason's friend and fellow operative Frank Woods (James C. Burns) disappeared in Angola investigating an arms smuggling ring. After aiding Jonas Savimbi's (Robert Wisdom) UNITA rebels against the MPLA, Mason and Hudson rescue Woods from a barge on the Cubango River, subsequently encountering Nicaraguan arms dealer Raul Menendez (Kamar de los Reyes). After a firefight, the trio are rescued by Savimbi, and Menendez is revealed to be Woods' captor. In September 1986, the CIA authorizes a strike against Menendez, now profiteering from the Soviet–Afghan War. The trio travels to Afghanistan, meets Chinese intelligence operative Tian Zhao (Byron Mann), and allies with the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviets. After capturing Colonel Lev Kravchenko (Andrew Divoff), Menendez's partner, Mason's brainwashing resurfaces. If Mason resists during Kravchenko's interrogation, the latter reveals Menendez has moles in the CIA before Woods executes him. Regardless, the mujahideen betray the Americans and Zhao, leaving them to die in the desert until their rescue by two travelers; Mason hallucinates that one of them is Viktor Reznov (Gary Oldman).</p>

		<p>Menendez's anti-American sentiment is revealed to have started after his sister Josefina (Eden Riegel) was disfigured in a fire linked to an American businessman's insurance fraud. When an earthquake in 1972 left his family destitute, Menendez and his father began running drugs, leading the CIA to assassinate his father. After Afghanistan, Mason, Woods, Hudson, and Panamanian forces led by Manuel Noriega (Benito Martinez) raid Menendez's compound in Nicaragua. Woods, seeking revenge, attempts to kill Menendez despite orders to take him alive. However, Woods accidentally kills Josefina, with Menendez also presumably killed; Menendez conspires with Noriega to fake his demise. In December 1989, during the American invasion of Panama, Mason and Woods capture Noriega for a prisoner swap, but Woods is tricked into shooting Mason. Menendez then reveals himself and shoots Woods in the kneecaps, crippling him; Menendez had previously kidnapped David, coercing Hudson into luring Mason and Woods into a trap. Menendez murders Hudson, before promising to complete his revenge against Woods in the future. In the aftermath, a handicapped Woods raises David in Mason's place, while hiding the true circumstances of his father's death.</p>

		<p>In 2014, Menendez forms a populist movement, Cordis Die. In 2018, the organization stages a cyberattack that cripples the Chinese stock exchanges, sparking a Second Cold War between NATO and the Chinese-led Strategic Defense Coalition headed by Zhao. By 2025, Cordis Die boasts an estimated two billion followers while David (Rich McDonald), now a DEVGRU Lieutenant Commander codenamed Section, leads JSOC and his squadmates Mike Harper (Michael Rooker) and Javier Salazar (Celestino Cornielle) to neutralize Menendez. Section and Harper visit "The Vault," a CIA retirement home where an elderly Woods resides. Woods tells them that Menendez recently visited him and gave him a heart-shaped pendant belonging to Josefina. Section and Harper listen to Woods recount his past encounters with Menendez.</p>

		<p>After raiding a Cordis Die compound in Myanmar, Section's team learns Menendez is planning a second cyberattack using 'celerium', a rare-earth element that could create a powerful computer virus. Spying on Menendez in Lahore, they discover he's after "Karma", a hacker named Chloe Lynch (Erin Cahill). The team infiltrates Colossus, an exotic, floating city in the Cayman Islands, aiming to rescue Lynch and kill Menendez's lieutenant, DeFalco (Julian Sands). Troubled by flashbacks of Panama, Section visits Woods again and learns the truth behind his father's death. On June 19, JSOC captures Menendez in Socotra, Yemen, with help from CIA agent Farid (Omid Abtahi). Menendez is escorted aboard the USS Barack Obama, commanded by Admiral Tommy Briggs (Tony Todd). During interrogation, Menendez escapes with help from Salazar, his mole inside JSOC. Menendez then uploads his celerium virus, hijacking all American drones, and sending them towards American and Chinese cities. Section responds to an attack on Los Angeles during the G20, where he escorts the U.S. President to safety with help from Secret Service agent Eric Samuels (John Eric Bentley). Menendez is tracked to Haiti, where Section leads JSOC to raid the Cordis Die facility. Section intercepts Menendez trying to flee and subdues him, with the decision to execute or reapprehend him.</p>

		<p>The ending achieved is determined by the fates of Menendez, Lynch, and Alex Mason, as well as whether the Strike Force missions were completed.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>If Section executes Menendez, a pre-recorded video is uploaded to YouTube in which Menendez posthumously commands Cordis Die to revolt. Cordis Die supporters launch a massive global insurrection, resulting in the burning of the White House and widespread anarchy. This ending is canon and sets the stage for Black Ops 7 and Black Ops III.</li>
				<li>If Section re-apprehends Menendez and Lynch survives, she will prevent Menendez's cyberattack and he will remain imprisoned, watching Lynch being interviewed on Jimmy Kimmel Live, where she insults Menendez as he rages in his cell.</li>
				<li>If Section re-apprehends Menendez and Lynch was killed or not rescued, Menendez's cyberattack will succeed, and he will break out of prison. He infiltrates the Vault and murders Woods with the heart-shaped pendant, then travels to Josefina's grave, digs up her corpse, and lights himself on fire.</li>
				<li>If all the Strike Force missions were completed, resulting in Zhao's assassination, China and the United States will ally, ending the Second Cold War. This is also considered canon for Black Ops III.</li>
				<li>Additionally, if Mason survives being shot by Woods, he will reunite with him and Section at the Vault in 2025. If he does not, Section retires from the military after visiting his father's grave. The latter ending is canon, with Mason's death setting the stage for Black Ops 6.</li>
